# Excel-Report-Automation

I automated a drug report analysis on Excel  for an informatic pharmacist at Kaleida Health Hospital in  Buffalo.

The programming language is VBA. Do consider that I wrote these codes before I took my computer science courses in Botegga University and before I learned about best practices.

I know how I can improve the code:

-Create functions so that I don't repeat code.

-Create more constant variables

-etc
